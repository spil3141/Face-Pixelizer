# Face-Pixelizer
>  A 2D pixel art generator, I utilized google's free and open-source library for machine learning to build a deep learning convolutional autoencoder trained to learn a pixelation effect function. 

Built with a bunch of things, to name a few: 
- [OpenGL v4.6](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [GLSL v330 core](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.3.30.pdf)
- [ImGui v1.78](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [Tensorflow v2.4](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Setup
#### Project build instruction
- clone the repo with ***--recursive*** flag
- run the *** GenerateProject.bat*** script in the Scripts folder to generate a visual studio 2019 solution. 
#### Dependencies setup
- This application uses python3.8 which requires specific packages, therefore it is important to install these packages before building the application. Use *** Face-Pixelizer/vendor/python3.8/requirements.txt *** with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
